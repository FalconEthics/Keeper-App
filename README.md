## Acknowledgments

" The transition from class components to functional components with hooks has revolutionized the development process, making it more concise, modular, and easier to understand. The introduction of hooks, such as useReducer, and useMemo, has provided powerful tools for managing state, side effects, and improving performance.

I wanted to take this opportunity to refresh my React skills and explore the latest features and best practices. By building the Keeper App using React, Tailwind CSS, Context API, Formik's auto animate, and Firebase, I aimed to create a full-stack application that showcases the capabilities of React and its ecosystem "
